# **End-to-End Chat Encryption Model**
- This project is solely made to depict the working of end to end chat encryption model used in various applications.
- It uses mainly two algorithms 
    - Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Encryption Algorithm (for key encryption/decryption and key exchange)
    - Cipher Algorithm for chat message encryption/decryption

# **How To Use This Project**
- First You must have a `python` version installed in your computer. You can download it from Here [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- To use it you need to first run (double click) the `server.py` file to start working the 1 client or server. Please keep the `server.py` prompt active.

- Then add a prime number into the command prompt of `server.py` file. As this will intiate it to listen for any input made my the other client.

- Now you can start/run the `client.py` file. 

- At this moment both the `client.py` and `server.py` prompts are connected to each other. 

- You can use them to see the working of encryption and decryption of chats and keys exchanging.
